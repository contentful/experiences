# examples/scripts

One-time setup scripts for the customer-facing example apps in [`../nextjs`](../nextjs) and [`../sveltekit`](../sveltekit).

## bootstrap-example.ts

Seeds the demo Experience into a Contentful space + environment via the experiences management API. After it succeeds, the example apps can fetch and render the seeded Experience by id.

### Run it

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in:
#   SPACE_ID          — id of the space you're seeding into
#   ENVIRONMENT_ID    — id of the environment (usually `master`)
#   CMA_TOKEN         — Personal Access Token (CFPAT-...) with write access
#                       to that space. Create one at
#                       https://app.contentful.com/account/profile/cma_tokens
#                       from within the org that owns the space.

npm install               # from the repo root, if you haven't already
npm run bootstrap
```

The script prints the resulting experienceId at the end — paste it into the example app's `.env.local` (or hit `/landing` directly if you left the fixture unchanged).

### What it seeds

The demo is a minimal `landing` Experience — one hero + two cards — that exercises the ExO composition pattern end-to-end. It provisions:

| Step | Resource type      | Count | Notes                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | ContentType        | 1     | `promotion` (title, teaser, body, ctaLabel, ctaUrl, image)                              |
| 2    | Asset              | 3     | hero background + 2 card images, read from `fixture/assets/` and uploaded to your space |
| 3    | Entry              | 3     | 3 `promotion` entries (hero + 2 cards)                                                  |
| 4    | DesignToken        | 15    | color/size/fontSize/fontWeight tokens referenced by Components                          |
| 5    | Component          | 8     | Section, Heading, RichText, Text, Button, Image (primitives) + hero-plain + card        |
| 6    | ExperienceTemplate | 1     | `page` (passthrough)                                                                    |
| 7    | DataAssembly       | 2     | `Hero from Promotion` + `Card from Promotion` (map entry fields to Component props)     |
| 8    | (linkage)          | 2     | Append DA links to hero-plain and card Components, republish                            |
| 9    | Experience         | 1     | `landing` — hero + Section(card, card)                                                  |

Each step is idempotent: if a resource with the fixture's id already exists, that step is skipped. Re-running against a half-seeded env picks up where a previous run left off.

### Fixture

The concrete data the script provisions lives in [`fixture/`](./fixture) — one TypeScript module per resource kind. If you want a different demo, edit those files rather than the bootstrap. `fixture/types.ts` documents each shape; every fixture module exports typed data the bootstrap imports directly.

### Known limitations

- **The ExO plain client methods used here (`component`, `experienceTemplate`, `dataAssembly`, `experience`) are marked `@internal` / experimental** in `contentful-management` and are subject to breaking changes without notice.
- **`/design_tokens` is called via raw `fetch()`** — the CMA dev build's plain client doesn't cover that endpoint yet. Customers setting up Experience Orchestration are encouraged to use the [Design System Import CLI tool](https://github.com/contentful/experience-design-system-sdk-public)
